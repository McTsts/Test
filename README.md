Roles

This is the default version of the Werewolves Revamped Role Book. The bot currently used on Mini Wolves Revamped and Werewolves Revamped implements all roles as they are listed in this document. Some of these roles are not considered to be "real roles", and aren’t used in Werewolves Revamped, however, they are still implemented in the bot and occasionally used in Mini Wolves. These roles can be found in section seven. The $info command will show the role description as listed in this document.

Each role that is listed in this document is also available on the [Werewolves Edge Case Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CMzqOWVDVrz9D0QXgSbMzfI_5AO4ajvXUNscD64zKBo/edit#gid=0), where interactions between all roles are clarified.

## 1\.   Role Related Rules

### 1.1 Abilities

**Basics**

There are several ways an ability can work. Some abilities are end-night/end-day, which means that they will be executed once the night/day ends. Other abilities are immediate. When a player uses an immediate ability it will be done as soon as possible by a Game Master (optimally it will be done immediately). 

**Delaying Abilities**

Delaying Immediate Abilities is not possible. One exception is that an immediate ability can be chosen one phase before it has to be executed (e.g. a Fortune Teller choosing a target during the day). If this is the case, the Game Masters will execute the immediate ability at an arbitrary time during its phase (the time can not be chosen).

**Immediate Abilities**

Immediate Abilities which are not investigative abilities can only be used once per phase, plus an emergency change once per game.

### 1.2 Attacks

**Basics**

Many roles or groups can attack. Attacks generally result in the attacked player dying, unless their role explicitly says otherwise. The player attacking another player is known as “Attacker”.

**Groups**

When a group (such as Cult or Werewolves) attacks a player, a random member of the group (who voted for the target) is chosen as the attacker. The group is not informed about this. Unless explicitly listed otherwise, this attacker is always considered as the sole cause of the attack, and never the group.

### 1.3 Disguises

**Basics**

There are several ways to obtain disguises, which mask what role an investigative role (other types of roles are generally not affected) sees a player as when inspecting them. Permanent disguises are either active from the start, or have to be selected once, and are always applied below all other disguises. Non-permanent disguises are applied on top of all current disguises. Only the topmost disguise is relevant for investigative roles. 

**Strong & Weak**

There are two types of disguises: strong ones and weak ones. If not explicitly listed otherwise, every investigative role is affected by strong disguises, and not affected by weak ones.

If the topmost disguise is a weak disguise, and a role is immune to weak disguises, the topmost strong disguise is relevant to that role.

When a player dies they first lose all weak disguises, and then all further consequences are executed, Lastly, all strong disguises are lost.

**Current Disguises**

• Archangel - permanent, weak

• Devil - permanent, weak

• Disguised Fox - non-permanent, weak

• Ice Queen - depends

• Psychopath - non-permanent, strong

• Sneaking Wolf - permanent, strong

• Tanner - non-permanent, weak

• White Werewolf - permanent, strong

### 1.4 Obstructions

**Basics**

Powers can be obstructed due to another role. If not explicitly listed otherwise, every role is not affected by obstructions.

**Current Obstructions**

• Flute Player/Enchanted - Enchanted investigative roles have a 60% chance that the player is seen as a Flute Player, and a 40% chance for a normal result

### 1.5 Role Loss

**Basics**

There are a couple of ways to lose your role. When you lose your role you keep your secret channels but lose all your abilities - unless explicitly listed otherwise.

**Current Role Losses**

• Vampire/Demonized/Undead - If a player that has been demonized by the vampire dies, they instead lose their role and become an undead.

• Plaguebearer/Tainted/Zombie - If a player that has been tainted by the plaguebearer dies, they instead lose their role and become a zombie.

• Infected Wolf - If an infected wolf targets a player they lose their role and become a werewolf.

• Infected Wolf/Devil/Demon - If an infected wolf targets a devil or demon, the infected wolf loses their role and becomes a demon.

• Infected Wolf/Archangel/Saint - If an infected wolf targets an archangel or saint, the infected wolf loses their role and becomes a saint.

• Fortune Apprentice - If a town investigative role dies, the fortune apprentice loses their role and turns into the role of the dead player.

• Apprentice - If a player dies, the apprentice loses their role and turns into the role of the dead player

• Dog/Look-Alike - When the Dog/Look-Alike makes their choice, they lose their role and turn into what they chose.

### 1.6 First Day 

**Basics**

'First Day' refers to ’Day 1’. Sometimes a game starts with ’Day 0’; despite this, ’Day 1’ is still considered to be the first day. Similarly, 'First Night' refers to ’Night 1’ and never ’Night 0’ (which is not usually used). This is relevant for roles that cannot or have to use their powers during the first day/night.

If the Grandma selects a player with several votes (e.g. Mayor or Grandma), they only lose 1 of their votes, but keep the others. The Grandma also only gains 1 vote, like normally.

The White Werewolf is strongly disguised as a regular wolf as long as they live.

**Gray Werewolf | Solo Killing**

Basics

The Gray Werewolf is a werewolf who is not satisfied with merely killing the townsfolk; they must kill all the werewolves as well. On even-numbered nights; the Gray Werewolf may kill a member of the wolfpack.

Details

The Gray Werewolf is similar to the White Werewolf. A difference is that the Gray Werewolf can also win while one other player is alive. The Gray Werewolf wins when the only remaining players are the Gray Werewolf; and optionally another player. Unlike the White Werewolf, the Gray Werewolf does not have a disguise. Killing a member of the wolfpack is an end effect. If only werewolves and the Gray Werewolf are left alive, the game ends in a Werewolf victory.

### 4.2 Flute

_'Flute' is the team of the Flute Player. Members of this team win when all players are dead, enchanted, or part of the team. Members of the team know each other._

**Flute Player** | Solo/Flute Power

Basics

Each night, the Flute Player may enchant two players. If all living players are either enchanted or Flute Player(s), the Flute Player(s) win.

Details

Whenever a player is enchanted, they will join a secret channel with the other enchanted players, excluding the Flute Player(s). The Flute Player(s) may see everything said in this channel, from the safety of their secret channel.

If an enchanted player is an investigative role, that is affected by obstructions, they will have a 60% chance that the player is displayed as a Flute Player, and a 40% chance for the inspection to happen normally, whenever they attempt to inspect/seek a player, This effect will disappear once all members of the flute team are dead. The players are not told when the effect disappears.

Enchanting a player is an immediate ability.   
If there are multiple alive Flute Players, then they are one team, and they will work together. If there is more than one player in the Flute Player channel, at the start of the night, each Flute Player will be able to enchant one player. If a Flute Player turns undead, they will lose their ability to enchant players; however if there are still one or more Flute Player(s) alive, the turned Flute Player will still be asked to enchant somebody.

### 4.3 Hell

_'Hell' is the team of the Devil. Hell wins when all players are either dead, soulless or part of the Hell team. All members of the team know each other and can never betray each other._

**Demon** | Solo/Hell Miscellaneous

Basics  
The Demon wins with the devil and joins a channel with the devil to communicate securely.  
Details  
The Demon is usually the result of someone copying the devil for various reasons. This is because the devil is too powerful for there to be two. Their win condition is the same as the Devil’s. The Demon starts out soulless.

**Devil** | Solo/Hell Killing

Basics

Each day, the Devil may choose a player to send the devil’s wager to. The target may choose to either learn another player’s role, or attack another player, but sell their soul in the process. The Devil has a variety of uses for souls. When everyone is dead or soulless the Devil wins.

Details

The Devil can't target soulless players. The wager is sent at the end of the day. The Devil can anonymously communicate with the target & will be notified of the result of the wager - they will learn who was attacked/which person was inspected & what role the target saw. 

If the player chooses to see another player’s role (immediate), it will be affected by weak disguises and obstructions. These effects are seen from the player’s perspective, not the Devil’s.

If the player chooses to attack another player (soul sold: immediately; kill executed: end-night), then they will become soulless. The attacker is the Devil. Using the wager to attack the Devil always fails.

The Devil can use a soul to protect someone else from all attacks for the next night (day; immediate) or kill a player of their liking (day/night; immediate). 

If the Devil is attacked at night and they have spare souls, they will be protected and a soul will be used up automatically. 

The Devil starts the game off with a single soul that they can use whenever.

At the start of the game, the Devil may choose a role as a weak disguise. If the Devil doesn’t choose a role, they will show up as a citizen.

**Undead** | Solo/Underworld Miscellaneous

Basics  
The Undead are the vampire’s secret army. If a demonized player is attacked during the night, they will lose their original role and become an Undead.  
Details  
When a demonized player is attacked during the night, they are now part of the vampire’s team, and they have the same win condition as the vampire; they will win once all players are either vampires, dead, or Undead.  
The Undead is one of the most complex roles in the game. The Undead is a dead player who pretends to be alive. They lose their previous role, but if they were part of a group like the wolfpack, they will remain in the channel and be able to vote as long as at least one other member of their group is still alive. However, in cases like the wolfpack, their vote will internally count for 0 when calculating the decision of the group poll. If all members of a certain group have been turned their ability will be lost. If all members of a group are dead or turned, the group is disbanded.

**Vampire** | Solo/Underworld Power

Basics  
The Vampire wins by secretly turning all the living players into undead. The Vampire demonizes players; if a demonized player is attacked in the night, they will instead turn into an undead.  
Details  
Each night, the Vampire may demonize a player. On even-numbered nights, the Vampire may demonize a second player. The target will not know about it by that time. When a demonized player is attacked, they will turn into an undead. The Vampire wins the game, along with the undead, if all players are either Vampire, dead or undead. If there are several Vampires, they work together.

Details 

Each night, the Ice King can submit a list of players. The amount of guesses is limited by the amount of players at the start of the game. For every 5 players, the Ice King gets 1 guess. If they have submitted all their guesses, all the players that the Ice King guessed correctly will be frozen. Frozen players are not notified about this, but their votes will no longer count in the public votes. Instead the Ice King gains that vote. One exception is the mayor - the second mayor vote is still counted. Guessing roles and freezing players is an immediate ability. The Ice King is an ice royal, knows the other ice royals and works together with them. The ice royals win when all players, except the ice royals, are frozen or dead. When the Ice King dies, all frozen players will be unfrozen and their vote will count again.

## 5\.   Unaligned Roles

_Unaligned roles are not part of any other team when the game starts. Some of these roles align themselves with one of the other teams during the game, while others can win with any team._

### 5.1 Unaligned Miscellaneous

_'Unaligned Misc' are those unaligned roles that do not fit any other category. Many of them can win the game by ascending, which means that even though they have won, the game continues, and a team can still win._

**Angel**

Basics

The Angel wins when they are lynched.

Details

When the Angel wins, the Angel ascends and stops playing. The game continues.  
On all public votes, the Angel starts out with -1 invisible votes. The Angel may select a player that dies when the Angel is lynched, if this player has voted for the Angel when the Angel is lynched, it is announced and they will also die. The Angel may change their target once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Angel wants to. If they haven’t, a random player that has voted for the Angel is selected instead. If the Angel is lynched by unusual means (e.g. by the invisible Stalker votes or the Executioner selecting them) the player responsible for this will die with the Angel. If nobody except the Angel has voted for the Angel, nobody dies. The Angel cannot select themselves.

**Chef**

Basics

The Chef can choose to make charmed food or poisoned food each night, and select a customer. The following day, the customer can decide to eat the food, and, depending on the food, gain invulnerability for the night or die. The Chef wins if they are alive at the end of the game, and at least one waiter remains.

Details

At the beginning of each day, the customer chosen by the Chef is allowed to eat the food. They can choose yes or no, but they don’t know what food the Chef sent them. If they eat the poisoned food, they die at the end of the day. If they eat the charmed food, they are invulnerable from night attacks for the next night. After the night ends, the effect of the charmed food disappears. 

Making food and selecting a customer is an end-night ability. Eating the food is an end-day ability.

Once a customer has eaten food, they can no longer be sent food.

Each game has a certain amount of players that are “waiters”, they are not informed about this, nor does it affect their win condition or ability. The waiters are on different teams. The Chef wins, if at least one waiter and the Chef itself are alive when the game ends. The Chef can win with any team, even if that team's win condition is to kill all others.

The Chef dies once they are unable to win; this usually happens when the last waiter dies.

**Despot**

Basics  
If the Despot is elected Mayor, they win. All players who voted for them as mayor will lose their public voting power for the next day phase.  
Details   
When the Despot wins, the Despot ascends and stops playing. The game continues.   
The votes of all players whose votes contributed to the Despot’s victory will be nullified the next day phase, for both the election and the lynch.

**Psychopath** 

Basics  
At the start of the game, the Psychopath is given a list of a third of the town’s population, rounded up. If all players on that list are dead, and the Psychopath is still alive, the Psychopath wins.  
Details  
When the Psychopath wins, the Psychopath ascends and stops playing. The game continues. If the number of players excluding the Psychopath is not divisible by 3, the number of players on the list is rounded up. The Psychopath can’t win when they are dead. The Psychopath may strongly disguise themselves as any role. They can update this disguise once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Psychopath wants to. 

**Riding Hood**

Basics

The Riding Hood wins when they are killed by the wolfpack.

Details

When the Riding Hood wins, the Riding Hood ascends and stops playing. The game continues.

The Riding Hood will also win if they are killed by a lycan, rather than by the wolfpack's kill. If the Riding Hood is killed in another way, they lose. If the Riding Hood is protected they do not die and ascend. When the Riding Hood is killed by the wolfpack, the pack does not get a kill the following night.

### 5.2 Unaligned Align

_'Unaligned Align' are those unaligned roles that join a team (become aligned) at some point in the game._

**Cupid**

Basics  
The Cupid chooses a player to be their lover and forms an inseparable team with that player.  
Details  
During the first night, the Cupid must choose a player to become their lover. If the Cupid does not choose in time, they will fall in love with a random player. The lover is added to the Cupid’s secret channel.  
The Cupid and their lover form an inseparable team; they will die if the other player dies. Choosing a lover is an immediate ability.

By default, the Cupid wins with the townsfolk team. If the lover is on a different team, they will only win when both win conditions are fulfilled. For example, if the couple is Cupid and a werewolf, everyone else must die. Another example is when the couple is Undead and a Vampire, then the normal Vampire win condition must be reached. Or, if they’re both townsfolk, they belong to the townsfolk team and can win together with them. The Cupid’s love overrides any other mechanic that may cause a player to change teams for any reason; the Cupid is always on the same team as their lover. After choosing a lover, unless they are also unaligned, the Cupid is no longer unaligned.

**Dog**

Basics

During the first night, the Dog may choose between town crier, cursed civilian or wolf, and will immediately become this role for the rest of the game.

Details

Choosing a role is an immediate ability. If the Dog hasn’t chosen a role before the night ends, the dog will be given the role of the citizen. After choosing a role the Dog is no longer unaligned.

**Look-Alike**

Basics  
The Look-Alike copies the role of another player during the first night.  
Details  
During the first night, the Look-Alike must choose a player. All data, including whether they are enchanted or not, demonized, in love, etc, is copied. If the Look-Alike does not copy a player in time, a target will be randomly selected for them.  
Choosing a player to copy is an immediate ability.  
The target is not told they have been copied by the Look-Alike. This means that if the Look-Alike copies a wolf, they will join the wolf ranks, but the werewolves will not be told who has been copied; it could be that they copied the white werewolf, after all. After using their ability the Look-Alike is no longer unaligned.

---

## 6\.   Elected Roles

_These roles are elected by a vote of the players during the day. Players who hold one of these roles do not lose their previous role but gain this one in addition. Players may hold two or more of these positions._

_These roles are elected in the particular order of precedence outlined below._

1.  _Mayor_
2.  _Reporter_
3.  _Guardian_

_Only one election takes place per day, for the topmost position on this list that is unoccupied at the start of that day. This means that the Mayor is elected first, followed by the Reporter, etc. However, if the Mayor dies, the next day will have a Mayor election instead of whatever role would have been next._

_A player that has an elected role may resign (end-night/end-day)._

**Mayor**

Basics  
The Mayor leads the town. They have the privilege of being able to post in #story\_time and receive an extra vote in polls. When there are more than 15 living players, instead of an extra vote the Mayor chooses each day whether the top one or the top two players being voted on will be lynched.  
Details  
The Mayor can be a powerful role to help either the innocent team or the werewolves team, but they tend to garner a lot of attention and may be killed quickly. If the Mayor misuses their ability to post in #story\_time, they may be demoted or killed at the discretion of the Game Masters. If there is no mayor, the lynch vote always only kills the top voted player.

**Reporter**

Basics  
The Reporter is notified of the roles of the dead.  
Details  
The Reporter has access to a secret channel with the roles of the dead. The roles given are impervious to powers such as the flute player or tanner. The roles given are always the role that player was originally assigned; a dog who chooses to become a cursed civilian, then gets turned into a wolf and finally dies will be shown to the Reporter as \`dog\`. The Reporter can be a powerful role to help either the innocent team or the werewolves team, but they tend to garner a lot of attention and may be killed quickly. The Reporter is elected on the first full day with a living Mayor and no living Reporter. 

**Guardian**

Basics  
The Guardian protects the town. When there are 12 or fewer players, the Guardian may choose one player. This player cannot be lynched the following day. When there are more than 12 they may choose up to two.  
Details  
The Guardian chooses their protected player(s) during the night, and they will be protected from the lynch for the following day. They may not change targets during the day. Guardians may not protect the same player two days in a row but may protect themself and/or alternate between two or more players. The people that are protected by the Guardian simply can't be voted for on the lynch. The Guardian is elected on the first full day with a living Mayor, a living Reporter, and no living Guardian.
